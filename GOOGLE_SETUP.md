# Quick Google OAuth Setup

## Create New Project (Recommended)
1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/
2. Create new project: "Lost and Found System"
3. Enable Google+ API
4. Create OAuth 2.0 credentials
5. Set redirect URI: http://localhost:5000/callback
6. Update .env file with new credentials

## Current Issue
Your OAuth app "smart classroom note generator" is blocking access.
Either update the existing app or create a new one for Lost & Found.
